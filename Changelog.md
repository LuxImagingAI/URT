# Changelog

## [0.1.2] - 2023.09.13

## [0.1.1] - 2023.09.12

## [0.1.0] - 2023.09.11

### Added
- Added new tcia_api class for handling the api calls
- Simplified handling of tokens and token renewal
- Logging via python logging library: better readability and flexibility
- Logs are stored in the "logs" folder with two different levels of verbosity
- API queries are now fault tolerant: multiple retries and increasing timeouts
- Downloader checks data integrity using MD5 hashes
- Checks for already downloaded data: works with renamed and mixed folders as well (if the script was interrupted during renaming)
- GET requests (not carrying large files) are cached to avoid overhead
- Removes unkown dicom files: avoids contamination by other datasets

### Changed
- Code refactored: better readability
- Replaced getDicomTag API call with metadata from getSeriesMetadata: substantial reduction of API calls
- Checks for file corruption are now much faster: removed calls to API (retrieves MD5 hash with image download instead)

### Removed
- Multiprocessing: now token renewal is handled in tcia_api
- tcia_utils library (replaced by own tcia_api class)
